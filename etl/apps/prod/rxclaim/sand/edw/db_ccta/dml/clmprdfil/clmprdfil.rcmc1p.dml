 BizComment:"The Medical Condition Code is a 7-digit number assigned to a unique medical condition.  The Medical Condition Code is not hierarchical-the hierarchy of medical conditions is supplied in the Medical Condition Classification Hierarchy File. The following codes in the Medical Condition Master File are reserved for some general cases applicable to this field: 0000000-None Use in associated databases when information relating to a medical medical condition does not exist. (For example, diarrhea due to Ceftin is not restricted to a certain population or medical condition.) 9999997-Unspecified Assigned in associated databases to represent situations for which as concept is not linked to a specific condition.  For example, the Therapeutic Range for digoxin (serum) is a 0.8 to 1.5 ng/ml for Congestive Heart Failure Medical Condition Code "95", and 3.0 or greater ng/ml for Unspecified Medical Condition Code "9999997". 9999998- Not Yet Available Medi-Span has not yet reviewed this drug. 9999999-Not Applicable Primarily used for devices and non-drug items.  It is used in associated databases when information relating to a medical condition is not appropriate or is beyond the scope of the associated databases.  (For example, insulin syringes, considered to be devices, are not expected to have adverse effects or indications.)"
