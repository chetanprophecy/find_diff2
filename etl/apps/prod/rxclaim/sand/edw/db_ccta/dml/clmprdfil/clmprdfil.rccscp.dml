This Basis allows the use of Copay Calc Basis '61'. If the submitted drug is labeled with a Multi-Source code = 'O' and Copay Calc Basis = '61', the system will calculate the DFT for Copay amount using a Generic equivalent product and Price Table.

This Copay Schedule Basis will always      begin on the first Step in order to obtain the days therapy      value, as indicated in the Days Supply field on the Copay      Schedule.  RxCLAIM will divide the prescription price by      the submitted days to obtain a Price per Day.  The Price per      Day amount is multiplied by the Days Supply value on the      first Step of the Copay Schedule to obtain the Price per      Days Therapy amount.  The Price per Days Therapy amount is      then compared to the value indicated in the Amt|Qty field      to determine upon which Step the copay will be calculated.      RxCLAIM will then multiply the Submitted Days by the value      indicated in the Days Supply field (always rounding to the      next whole number) to obtain the factor by which the value      indicated in the $ Amt|Factor is multiplied.

Copay is calculated by      by taking the Higher of the Minimum Copay from the Price      Schedule Table multiplied by the step number from the Copay      Schedule step being used, versus the results of a comparison      of the lower of the Flat $ amount from the Copay Schedule,      versus the % of DFT from the Copay Schedule.  Then any amount,      calculations, or comparisons from the Copay Calc Basis Code      will be applied.  Then, the Copay Comparison Code will be      applied. l = L Drug Cost|DS This Basis allows the use of Copay Calc Basis '61'. If the submitted drug is labeled with a Multi-Source code = 'O' and Copay Calc Basis = '61', the system will calculate the DFT for Copay amount using a Generic equivalent product and Price Table. If the incoming drug is not Multi-Source code = 'O' or Copay Calc Basis is blank, the system will calculate DFT using the submitted product. m = Mbr/FillDt/DtWrt/MD-Sched F1 : Copay Schedule Basis "m" will charge one copay per member,      per fill date, per date written, per prescriber.  There is      a maximum of 6 claims/copay.

Copay is calculated      by taking the Flat $ amount from the Copay Schedule plus the      Copay Schedule % multiplied by DFT - the Amt|Qty from the      previous step within the Copay Schedule, if any. o = L CDFT|DS $Current Step +     {%(CDFT - $Current Step - Max Amount Previous Step)}.     Schedule Only. F1 : The determination of the step is based on the Calculated Drug      Cost + Fee + Tax (CDFT) and Submitted Days Supply.  The      percentage copay is based on the calculated price amount that      is in excess of the Maximum Amount/Quantity from the previous      step, plus the flat dollar copay from the same step.  If a      previous step does not exist, then only calculate the flat      dollar copay based on the figure in the '$ Amount/Factor'      field.  If the selected step has a Maximum Amount/Quantity      that is equal to or lower than the figure indicated in the      previous step's Maximum Amount/Quantity field, then only      calculate the flat dollar copay based on the figure in the      '$ Amount/Factor' field.  Code 'o' is Schedule Only. p = App Patient Pay = $.00 F1 : If Rebill processing is NOT being used within pricing, then      this Copay Schedule step has no effect whatsoever on the      claim's adjudication.  The claim processes as if there was no      Copay Schedule specified.      If Rebill processing IS being used within pricing but the      Patient Pay Comparison Code on the Pharmacy Price Table has a      value NOT = 'A' or '5', then this Copay Schedule step has no      effect whatsoever on the claim's adjudication.  The claim      processes as if there was no Copay Schedule specified.      If Rebill processing IS being used within pricing and the      Patient Pay Comparison Code on the Pharmacy Price Table has a      value = 'A' or '5', then the claim processes as follows:      The Pharmacy Price Table's determination for approved (and      response) Patient Pay is set to $.00, the Patient Pay $ amount      as determined within the Rebill price table is added to the      Pharmacy Price Table's determination for the approved (and      response) Amount Due. q = App Cost-Schedule Only F1 : The Approved Ingredient Cost is used to determine the Copay      Schedule Step to be used. It does not consider fee or tax      in its calculations. This basis code indicates schedule only.      Price Table copay information is ignored, except for Patient      Pay Comparison and Patient Pay Minimum. r = App Cost-Schedule & Calc Basis F1 : The Approved Ingredient Cost is used to determine the Copay      Schedule Step to be used. It does not consider fee or tax      in its calculations. This basis code indicates schedule plus      Calc Basis Code. Price Table copay information is ignored,      except for Copay Calc Basis Code, Patient Pay Comparison and      Patient Pay Minimum. s = Quantity Eaches; Step1 F1 : Based on quantity for products with a Unit of Measure that is      'Each', otherwise use step 1. Copay $Amount/Factor field is used      as a Factor.      Claims for products with a Unit of Measure (UOM) of 'Each' are      stepped based on the submitted quantity compared to the Step      Maximum quantity.  Claims for products with a UOM other than      'Each' use Step 1 (for one copay). t = DS:Fill Dt/List/Sbm Days F1 : This copay schedule basis will calculate a copay based on days      supply using the copay fields from the schedule.  If a percent      copay is specified, the percent is based on the Drug + Fee + Tax.      All claims with the same fill date, from the same NDC or GPI list      and within the Submit days window are considered 1 copay not to      exceed the maximum copay. u = Solid Oral Dose by QTY F1 : This value is used to provide a copay that is by quantity for the      Solid Oral Dose Products.  Products that are identified as      Non-Solid Oral Dose are not stepped and always use the first step      of the copay schedule, regardless of the quantity.  Solid Oral      Dose Products are defined as those that meet the following      criteria sets: Criteria Set 1 (Unit of Measure=Each; Route of      Admin=Oral; Dosage Form is one of the following: CAPS; CHEW; CPCR;      CPDR; CPEP; CPSP; CP12; CP24; GUM; KIT; LOZG; MISC; TABS; TBCR;      TBDP; TBEC; TBEF; TBSO; TB12; TB24; WAFR) or Criteria Set 2 (Unit      of Measure=Each; Route of Admin=MT; Dosage Form is one of the      following: GUM; LOZG; TROC) or Criteria Set 3 (Unit of Measure=      Each; Route of Admin=BU;Dosage Form is one of the following: LPOP;      MISC) or Criteria Set 4 (Unit of Measure=Each; Route of Admin=SL;      Dosage Form is one of the following: SUBL) v = L Qty|Days Supply      If either the submitted quantity or submitted days supply exceeds      the corresponding step value, then go to the next step."
